									<h3>University Student Database<br></h3>
									<p>In the university student database project, we aimed to establish a seamless data flow using Tableau Prep, ensuring efficient data integration and transformation. To enhance the user experience, we created design templates with Figma that are compatible with Tableau, enabling visually appealing and intuitive dashboards. We focused on cleaning the data to ensure accuracy and consistency, followed by extracting the necessary data to support various analyses and reporting needs.
										 This approach streamlined the data management process, facilitating effective data-driven decision-making within the university.</p>
